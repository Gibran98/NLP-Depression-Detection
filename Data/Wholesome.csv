"I rescue tortoises on a regular basis, this is not cute. This is blatant aggression, tortoises are solitary animals and shouldn‚Äôt be kept in groups. This could lead to tortoise injury or death.

(Edit) if kept in groups they should have 1 male to 3 female ratio, but even sometimes that doesn‚Äôt work.

Some injuries I have seen from the rescues I have taken in are broken jaws, cracked shells, missing eyes, and missing nails. All of these injuries have been caused from being kept in pairs/groups.

If you have any questions I will do my best to answers.
Thank you.",0

I gave my tortoises to someone and they post pic on their fb of them eating at the community garden all the time.  They have become like the mascots for the garden and more people have been coming to grow things they can eat. She told me she hasn't had to buy food for them yet because they grow so much and she cans a bunch of it. Its really nice when we give them a good home but the go to a great home!,0

So cute. Babushka Tortoise dolls.,0
"When I was a kid we had two turtles and my cousin's had two.  We got them all at the same time from the same pet store. My parents had an inline water filter, one that is before the tap (installed under the counter) so ours only got filtered water. After a year ours were as large as that middle size one in the video and theirs were smaller than the small one (they hardly grew) so my cousin's tired of them and gave them to us.  After a week or so one of the small one's shell was floating in the tank and a few days later the other one was floating too.  Since there was no sign beyond just the shell I can only imagine the large ones ate the small ones....

I really hope that doesn't happen here.",0

"Okay first of all ...these are not store bought tortoises. There are mountains in our surroundings. In the rainy seasons, a lot of tortoises wash out of the mountains. We found the largest one an year back, washed out on the road and slightly injured. We were afraid he was going to get run over so we took him home. 

In some time he became the family pet, but as we live in an apartment, there was no fresh earth for him to move around. We thought about returning him to the mountains, but were not sure whether he will survive the wild, after getting used to life as a pet.

So we gave them to our friend. She has a farmland, with soft earth. Also the other two smaller ones are females. There are no food fight, they just always move together, sit together. He is much more active there than he was here. And he is getting fresh sunlight.",0

Best way to raise a kid,0
"If i have kids at some point. I refuse to yell at them or hit them.

"Some parents have absolutely no idea on how much psychological damage can be caused by losing their rag over the smallest of issues, all of which won't matter a few minutes later.",0

Yes. Just yes,0
That's + nice,0
This was painful to try and read..,0
"My wife and I parent the same way, we have a wonderful daughter that is now 4 and so damn well adjusted. We were both abused physically and emotionally as children. It is so healing to know we are not passing on that trauma to her and so excited to see what she does with her life, even if it's not ""special"" it will be to us. She is loved, respected, and taught healthy coping mechanisms to deal with the world.  

Unfortunately, not everyone learns from the mistakes of their parents and the pain continues.",0
This does put a smile on my face.,0

"I don‚Äôt have children but posts like this give me hope for the future. I remember the day when I dropped a bowl of cereal in the kitchen and it broke my mom started cussing, yelling, and smacked me. Then my step-dad in his drunken stupor dragged me to my room proceeded to beet me with his belt and then locked me in my room for the rest of the day. I had welts on my back for a week and a half and had to learn to sleep on my stomach because they hurt so much.

Parenting 101,0
"When I was ~10 or so I clogged the toilet without realizing and went outside to play for an hour or so. I came back and there was a ton of water in the bathroom and it had leaked down into the basement. My mom had a tendency to yell at me so I was absolutely terrified. She saw what happened,  just kinda laughed and helped me clean it up. Thats the day I learned laundry by washing every towel we owned. 

My mom is and was a great mom, just had a short fuse sometimes.",0
"Okay the + everywhere is confusing the hell out of me, someone explain",0
"Yeah, my dad used to flip his lid if my sister or I spilled something. I love my dad dearly, but looking back there were a lot of normal kid things that he used to get mad over that even as an adult I don‚Äôt understand why. He‚Äôs mellowed over the years, thankfully.",0
"Long time ago one a friend of mine broke a cup, his grandma instead of getting mad asked him ""was it an accident?"" He said yes and she was like oh it's fine then, it's just a cup. I'll never forget that cause it was such a different reaction than I was used to",0
Yes + yes,0
"Congratulations on breaking the cycle of abuse. It has been passed down through the generations; violence, shaming, and humiliation. This is why so many people home school as well. We were bullies, too, and/or bullied. Now that we have broken the cycle, we don't want to throw our kids to the children who are still suffering.",0
Same,0
"My mom yelled at me because SHE broke her favotite coffee cup,  i will never do that i will be better",0
"My used to do that. If you fall and trip you don't do it because you want to make a mess. It's important to teach children incidents happen and when they do you should stay calm, and deal with it",0
"My parents were/are big yellers/screamers, I always tell myself that when I have kids I will never be like that. This really is parenting done right, your kids should never fear you or feel like making a mistake is wrong and they're terrible for messing up. Let them understand mistakes are natural, everyone makes them, and you'll be there to help them, not shame or punish them for it. Even if you do lose your cool and yell, apologize and admit that itself was a mistake, as even adults make them, and you didn't mean to frighten or hurt them with your words/volume",0

Ok this warms my heart...,0
"I didn't experience,  grow up with anyone, or know any of my parent friends in my adult years who would yell and hit their child for slipping and spilling cereal.... is this like abnormal? This deserves applause??",0

"FUCK     YEAH,thats how you raise a kid",0
cringe,0
Just say and instead of +,0
"I like this so much. I still have an instant of panic if I drop something. So stupid. Used to be an automatic cause for my Dad to get angry at me. It's an honest mistake ffs, chill, I tell myself now.",0
Yeah some  old school parents would fuckin flip out expecting you to never make a mistake. This mother is raising her child right.,0
"You should NEVER hit you kid and no excuses! However yelling is sometimes needed for example if your child does domething life threatening like hanging out of a window but if you yell at them for doing something like walking away from and getting lost you will just mess up the kids head.

Your child is probably thinking that they will have to live on their own forever without parents or something and thats traumatising enough, they have already been tought their lesson. if you yell at them YOU will just traumatise them more and it worse.",0
Reading this gave me a stroke lmao,0
Thank you you just made my day,0
"Sounds like you accepted that regret doesn't need to be instilled. It needs to be managed productively. Sounds like the child accepted that fact, seeing how she volunteered to help you clean up the mess.

The world is as excited as you are about your child growing up with a cool headed approach to misfortune!",0

Stabilizing her friends head after she passes out twice on a sling shot,0
This is the first time I have seen 1 of these videos where the friend or family member actually tries to help the floppy-headed rider after they pass out,0
"What are you doing?

Im holding your neck so you don't get whiplash

What?

W h i p l a s h",0
this is a good friend. to give up their good time to ensure someone else doesnt have a trash neck for the rest of their life,0
She seems like a really nice friend!!,0
Those hair floating back and forth are so satisfying to watch.,0
"Is she saying ‚Äòyou have a pulse?‚Äô Is that why she‚Äôs counting?
Super quick reflexes though",0
I love how she goes from passed out to immediately excited again,0
/u/stabilizebot,0
Jesus . Good on her for noticing . That could have been a horrible case of whiplash if not worse .,0
That‚Äôs a good friend right there. Clearly pretty scared herself but takes the time to have the clarity and concern to look out for her friend.,0
What an absolute sweetheart!!,0
I'm so impressed. What a fucking awesome friend/person!,0
"Curious, on these rides, do people pass out from the fear? Or from the G-force of the movement?",0
I thought the title meant like the video was stabilized on her head and I was confused when nothing was happening,0
I'd like to know how many Gs her head is experiencing whipping back into the headrest. Seems we can get TBIs remarkably easily so I hope there's adequate padding.,0
Why do people even get into these kind of rides? To passout and then barf infront of thousands of people?,0
Good on her I did this once in middle school and got made fun of for being ‚Äúgay‚Äù,0
"Does anyone else find it incredibly cute that this girl is telling her friend, don‚Äôt worry, you have a pulse. ü•∞",0
that‚Äôs a good friend,0
My friends would slap my head so it bounces off harder,0
"Did she call out ""good you have a pulse""? If so, she must surely be a doctor or a nurse! Epic level friend / sister to have in this situation",0
Top level awareness,0
"Fuck those rides, they‚Äôre not for me!",0
"Alright so question: if you‚Äôre wearing goggles or glasses, how do you make sure they don‚Äôt fly off?",0
"All I can think of is ""the whiplash is real"".",0
Just watching this gave me a stomach & headache,0
Yikes,0
"i liked the 
‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt that bad!‚Äù ‚Äúyou passed out twice‚Äù",0
People can actually pass out on something like this?,0
"Oh, I thought the clip was stabilized, lol.

No, that‚Äôs actually really nice. I don‚Äôt think those rides are dangerous, and I‚Äôd bet the harness are padded partly for this very reason.

But she still went out of her way to help. This clip sparks joy.",0

Within a year of picking it up again I have decreased my hand pain by 80% and decreased the frequency of dislocations in my hands by 65% and I‚Äôd give ANYTHING to be able to tell my grandma this incredible thing that‚Äôs happened because of her, but she doesn‚Äôt know anything anymore.

Repost but still wholesome,0
"I once lived in a small town (Arcata, for those who know it), and worked at a coffee shop in a grocery store for a bit. The coffee shop is at the front of the store, pretty much parallel to the registers.    

One day there was about 45 seconds where time seemed to stop within the store. Everything went very quiet, and there was very little motion at any register. I am a very short adult, so I could barely see over the counter and didn't know what was going on, but could tell everyone was focused on one of the middle checkout registers.

I then saw a little wobbly kid step into my field of view, coming from that checkout line. Everyone staring had a ""Wow, what a precious moment!"" look on their face. Based upon the reactions I saw, I wondered if it was that child's first steps. 

I was snapped back into the reality that I was at work, and had work to do. I never did find out if those were first steps or just a lot of people fawning over a cute kid, but I still think about it 15 years later.",0

"I can't help the feeling sometimes like this is the path I should have gone down. I think I used to be like this, happy and free.

In ways its been worth it. I enjoy being strong, and tough. I enjoy thorny concepts like obligation, dedication, maturity and sacrifice. I feel all but bulletproof.

And yet.

It's got its own problems. I have had so much difficulty in expressing myself (and I consider myself as having a talent for expressing ideas) and my emotions. I don't feel comfortable expressing my emotions and receiving positive attention.. I have trouble trusting people. I often worry about my body image, and other things. I question my sexuality. I think it stems from my never properly learning the skills necessary for dealing with these things, and now it's coming back to haunt me.

If anyone can link me to some relevant subreddits I would be so grateful. I need somewhere I can talk about my experiences and learn some skills to manage my emotions.",0

While implying that all girls: wear flowers, dance, wear pink, bake cakes, are scared, artsy, are all feminist, are kind and are all superheroes.

Both stereotypes condensed into single poster.

This breaks my heart. You know the kid says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be scared‚Äù because other people have made him feel bad for being happy and excited. This kid is a beautiful human being ‚ù§Ô∏è,0

"This was sweet but would have been even better if the driver had consoled the passenger who was getting anxious about the driver possibly being ""scared"" of him, and just clarified that he was happy the passenger was so excited.

Damn now I‚Äôm crying,0
Ooh surprised to hear Romanian!,0
ik it sounds rude but does this guy have a mental disorder or something? just the way his hands act tips me off but his giddy attitude is kind of suspicious too,0
I found this so wholesome and amazing! He got his dream and the driver is probably his savior because he gave the man his dream.,0

Wow. What a cool dad.,0
how do you know someones sexuality since they were six?,0
And now I‚Äôm crying,0
This is sweet. I've told me kids over and over again that if they are gay I would love them the same as if they were straight.  It doesn't matter to me. They are 14 and 11 and I even though I feel they are heterosexual I still  want them to know I would love them anyhow. I don't want them to hide who they may be for years and years until they were to build up the confidence to tell me or their dad that they are gay.,0
I‚Äôve seen this before but it‚Äôs nice,0

"I've always thought of this as wholesome but reading it again, I feel like it steals the thunder from the kid a little bit.

I'm probably overthinking it. :)",0
What I wish my family was like,0
"My mom found out I was bi from snooping through my stuff, and immediately chose to pick a fight about it. somehow, it was a personal attack on her. She told everyone in my family and my dad denied it straight away. I don‚Äôt know how they feel about it now since it‚Äôs been years (and I‚Äôve been to pride parades and have had a girlfriend), but I really wish I had a cool dad like that.",0
"That's super cute though I can't help but wonder if it would have been kinder to let the kid come out face to face and have this said to him face to face.  Now although he knows, it hasn't been said explicitly and may feel like the elephant in the room we know about but don't talk about to him going forward (accidentally)",0

"If anyone is wondering how I got into contact with someone with corona I‚Äôll explain here:

My dad is running for city chairman. He needed a signature from a man in order to be on the papers or something. (It wasn‚Äôt online because. And this may sound rude. The people who run my city are old white people. They aren‚Äôt with tech and prefer everything in person.) my dad got the signature and returned home. A few days later my dad gets a phone call from the man saying that he has corona and he should get checked out. I got furious. I don‚Äôt care if I have it but I have a BABY SISTER in the house who is in DANGER!!! I‚Äôm getting check and if I‚Äôm positive I‚Äôm going to the hospital ASAP. Getting the hell away from my baby sis.

Edit: went to go get tested. I only had one place that was 39 miles away (I think it‚Äôs 34 miles) it hurt a lot. Had to put a long qutip? Idk how to spell it. I had to put a long qutip in my nose. It felt so awful. It felt like I was poking my eye. It was there for 7 sec and I had to rotate it inside my nose. I broke it off and put it inside a small vile. Idk when I get my results.

Anyone wondering how it went. It went really well. It was fast too because she agreed to go out with her dad (her parents are divorced she doesn‚Äôt see her dad often) we were together for 15 min and she left. It started often with myself touring brandon. He saw everything. Put on a quick uniform and went to work. Melissa and I were messing around and starting ordering stuff and acting like Karen‚Äôs. And my friend Brandon acted like a calm and collective young adult. It was funny and he billed us a lot for our food. I took a pic of the event but I didn‚Äôt record. Someone said I should record but I didn‚Äôt get to. I told him I‚Äôll record later and reply what went down but I don‚Äôt think I will today. She‚Äôs somewhere with her dad. She most likely won‚Äôt be back till late at night but it‚Äôs okay. If anyone wants to see the pic I‚Äôll post it on my account.,0

Well they were wrong because I WANT HIM,0
It was just meant to be.,0
Didn‚Äôt see that coming!,0
"I call Bull on no one wanting it. I use to work for a shelter and the ones that went the fastest were the ones with disabilities like this or if they were missing a leg. Animals with Heath problems were the ones that we had issues with, who wants to adopt a dog u have to give insulin to? Otherwise this is adorable",0
They were made for each other ‚ò∫Ô∏è,0
I would adopt a one-eyed dog any day,0
Who wouldn't want that cute puppy!,0
<3,0
I am still confused which one of the dude's eyes is the one which can see,0
"its wholesome till one night he leans into the dogs ear and whispers ""I'm gonna need that eye""",0
Hmm should probably keep the road on their right when going on walks,0
They‚Äôre both so cute nobody cares about the eyes,0
He bought him?,0
Because that‚Äôs what heroes do,0
Hahahaha I know that guy irl,0
Half-seen that coming,0
Just because no one else wanted the dog‚Äôs eye doesn‚Äôt mean he can have it.,0
Why did no one else want the eye?,0

This really should be a trend,0

that family is some of the most lovely people I‚Äôve ever met.",0
Im going to do that the next time I order something online,0

Sorry cant comment. Cutting some onions here.,0

"Congratulations to this happy couple! I love hearing about couples who have been together forever & are still crazy about each other!

My Husband asked me to marry him on our first date, & we were married shortly thereafter. On January 26th we'll celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. When you find someone who loves & adores you, don't take that for granted; make sure they know how much you love & appreciate them for that.

Most of us want to feel appreciated; respected/trusted; supported; & desired: so make an effort to make them feel those things every single day. Those are the 4 cornerstones necessary for the strong foundation you'll need to build your relationship, & eventually, if you so choose, a family. 

Your partner isn't perfect, but neither are you. Be understanding, accepting, & forgiving when they're having a bad day, because you appreciate them for reciprocating & loving you even when you're having a bad day.

I've never felt like marriage is hard work. Loving my Husband has never been hard work for me. I prefer to compare marriage to a garden. The more time & effort you put into it, the more you'll get out of it. If you ignore & neglect it, the weeds will take over & choke out all the beautiful flowers & sweet fruit's. But the more time & effort *you both* put into nurturing & tending to it, the more rewards you'll get back out of it. 

Good communication is imperative. You can't ignore problems & hope that they'll work themselves out. That's like asking the groceries in your pantry to bake themselves into a cake: it's just not going to happen. 
I've learned that people will frequently mirror back to you whatever behavior you're exhibiting. If you want more of a certain behavior, start exhibiting that behavior yourself. 

And finally, NEVER STOP FLIRTING! Make suggestive comment's; hold hands; pinch, squeeze, or smack one another's bum when you're getting up or walking past each other. Don't stop sending cute or flirty texts, or sending sexy ""I miss you"" memes to each other. What matters most is all of the sweet, kind, ""little things"" that you do to make the other person feel loved & appreciated.",0
With that surname though it couldn‚Äôt have been otherwise.,0
Very wholesome indeed!,0
"This makes my heart melt. That's the only way to make love last. You have to accept that the person you're with will make mistakes, but in the end the love overrules all of that ‚ù§Ô∏è",0
Great reminder Jim!  That's love.,0
"""Perfect acceptance of an imperfect person.""

Please tell him congratulations from a total stranger.  He is proving himself to be stronger than any pain.,0
If he likes to cook he should def apply at all restaurants for dishwashing and work his way into the rotation. They don‚Äôt care about that background and it‚Äôs a great career.  I‚Äôve seen a lot of rehabilitated men make great careers out of it.  Good luck to him and to you.,0

Hell yeah man!,0
"Hey, I know this shit is hard. But keep this in mind you're not alone. Others have walked this path and you can to. When you feel that pressure building just get in that 3 foot world, focus on that next step and you'll make it happen. You got this.",0

I have a blind and deaf pupper. The trick I use is to slowly place treats in front of his nose until he wakes up and eats em,0

"We had a kid with autism who was also in a wheelchair. He was an active member of our schools event committee: he was in the dances at basketball halftime show, he helped hold the banner at baseball games, he helped make every dance fun and accessible, and he was probably one of the most popular kids in our school. Everyone knew him, everyone loved him, and now I wonder how he is doing since Highschool. I hope he‚Äôs doing well!",0
"My cynicism is telling me this must've been a high school from back during the Hotwheels craze in the 90s-early 2000s. Unfortunately, something like that wouldn't happen nowadays. Still wholesome, though. Just wish enthusiasm like this was more widespread rather than the overly politicized divide that exists in today's schools.",0
This is so amazing,0
Imagine how much of a baller you have to be to get a hot wheels cape. That‚Äôs dope,0
Why does me heart feel like a warm puddle?,0
this is whne you know your highschool has a secret hotwheels race group and nearly everyone is in it including the kid,0
 That is the cutest,0
"This is so amazing, it makes me feel happy inside.",0
"It sounds wholesome but it just sounds more like they pitied him. When people find out you're disabled, they either reject you or they pity you. Rarely do people actually care. It's because able-bodied folks just don't understand. As someone who's autistic myself, I know this to be true. It's not a real-life example, per se, but a good example of this is the sitcom Speechless. The main actor actually does have cerebral palsy so I know that all of the serious stuff pertaining to disability is true. People pity your disability, put you up on a pedestal, they don't treat you like a regular person. Or they do the opposite and treat you like a degenerate. It's one thing to accommodate disability, it's entirely another to treat it like ""Oh, poor you""...",0
r/aww,0
The kids really are alright.,0
Imagine the look on his face if everyone pitched in and got him a car that looked like a giant hot wheels car on Christmas,0
Awwwe,0
There's this blind kid in my grade thats so nice. Im one of the 3 ppl who talk and hang out with him and he's super nice.,0

"And then the child with special needs became a man with special needs. It wasn't cute anymore, so people stopped trying to be his friend. Without abilities to self-care, he continued to live with his parents until they died. When they died, the only two people that cared for him died. He then became homeless and died alone in the streets a short time later.",0

Classic dad. Says they hate pets but when the family actually gets one they immediately become best friends cause why not",0
"Looks like you need a new cat.
This ones now your dad's cat.",0
The memes are TRUE,0
r/dadswhodidntwantpets,0
The same thing happened with my Step-dad. He was opposed to the idea of getting any pets ( except the cat he got for my mom ) and then we get a dog and he spoils the dog like he's one of his kids.,0
Wholesome video but that music is god awful,0
That kitty is in for a lifetime of loving and doting! ‚ù§Ô∏è,0
"This dad is technically a hypocrite, the best kind of hypocrite.",0
Well looks like someone's getting a cat for thier birthday.,0
"This is very wholesome but he does have a point most pets can be dirty, especially cats during the summer, my cat is always covered in small plants and other stuff when she comes back inside",0
"The thing with parents not wanting pets is that they often don't want to tell their children the real reason, which is that they can't take the risks of owning a pet and covering the costs of feeding them and potentially paying vet bills on top of vet bills to cover pet emergencies or injuries.

My mom never allowed us to keep any at all because she sees money as reserved for her children and not animals. It took me a really long time to understand that. When my mum hangs out with my dog she loves her to bits. She just won't keep one.

Parents who show restraint and know proper care of animals are doing the right thing by refusing pets.",0
"Same thing happened with my father too. Me and my mother wanted to adopt a dog(back in July) and my father didn't agree. We got her(the dog)anyway,and now my dad loves her a lot",0
"It's weird how much this music appeals to me... It clashes, but oh, it appeals somehow.",0
Grumpy dads and the pets they did not want:,0
"weirdest application of this song ever.

Weirdest music choice for this kind of vid,0
"I like babies too, and will play with one if you bring it over, just not having any of my own. Totally understand your daddy although he's really cute playing and cuddling with your furry baby.",0
"Asian here and this is so real. Asian parents be like this lmao. That generation often grew up with strict parents and never kept pets, so they did the same for their kids too. It‚Äôs good that we can sometimes ‚Äúgo against‚Äù parents and let them experience the happiness of keeping pets.",0
"Hahaha love it! 
After our family dog passed, I asked my family to catsit while we went out of town. They all did this, searched for cat when they got home, played with her, laid on the floor. So cute ü•∞",0
Awww,0
"So cute, I needed this",0
They better get that cat out of the house or he's never going to let them take it home.,0
The dad never wants the pet but when they get one they're inseparable trust me,0
HAHHAHAHAH these are my parents,0
Is that a 'Hello Kitty' blanket.,0
He probably was told he couldn‚Äôt have petsü•∫,0
"THOSE HYPOCRITES ARE ALL SAME!!!

No pet in house dad and the pet is best duo ever.",0
/u/savevideo,0
Oooomg this is so fucking precious üòªüòªüòª,0
Wait the memes were... speaking the truth?!,0
"So he was told this when he grew up I guess? And then just passed on the message without thinking about it? Because he is clearly enjoying himself a lot, and good for him! Pets are lovely! :)

I know of people that genuinely didn't like certain animals, and it didn't matter if they were given the chance to get to know said animals. Still didn't like them.",0
I believe people who hate pets have never owned a pet,0
Dads usually dont want pets because they know how it feels to see them pass away,0
The difference now is that it‚Äôs not his responsibility to take care of the pet and the pet is just a visitor. Kinda like how grandparents treats grandchildren very differently than how they treat their own kids.,0
"u/savevideo

i need this in my life.",0
"Wow! I never would have realized he was Asian! I don't think I would have understood what was going on if they didn't tell me, thank goodness.",0

"Today a man came to me asking for money for bread. But mostly everyone that's homeless spends it on alcohol or something. The world is trash and people are too. Yeah kindness is good and all but don't do it too much. Also another example: a couple of days ago a homeless guy asked me to shave him at my home and he said he's gonna pay me and that there isn't any open barber.

Before I could, another dad with us got out a tool kit, walked over to the swearing teen and said, ‚Äúhey, let‚Äôs flip your bike over and figure out what‚Äôs wrong with it.‚Äù They worked on it. Got it fixed. The teenager super appreciated it, and was totally cool to our group the rest of the night.

Someone find this guy and buy him a top notch skateboard signed by Tony Hawk or something he deserves it,0
"as a skater myself, i‚Äôve seen first hand how kind and accepting the skating community is.  i know we get a bad rap for drugs and the way we look, but honestly skaters are some of the nicest people i‚Äôve met.

reminds me of the time i saw a kid with down syndrome show up at the park one time and i‚Äôm not even exaggerating when i witnessed almost every skater take turns teaching him how to skate and giving them each their individual tips

big shoutout to that mom and girl btw, we need more female skaters because they‚Äôre usually the coolest ones out there",0

"Honestly.... I had the same experience!
I'm female and wanted to learn skating with another female friend. We all lost contact but after like the first visit we were all instant friends. We instantly got help.

They LOOK scary, especially as small teenage girls, but they were one of the most helpful people I've met, just in their own way..  They were still ""weird"", swearing a lot and all that stuff. But still really helpful to people sharing their hobby.",0

"It seems like the skater community has changed in the last ten years. I was scared to go to skateparks when I was like, 10-14, because I sucked and got figuratively pushed out of the way by all the teens trying to be bad boiz. And it seemed ‚Äúcool‚Äù to me as a kid when I tried to break my board when I couldn‚Äôt get a trick down because I saw videos of people doing it. I‚Äôve been getting back into skating recently and it just seems like there‚Äôs a million people trying to keep skating alive and giving it a whole new scene like this photo.",0
This is the type of human I want to raise,0
i did something similar once and got the cops called on me,0
"Skaters are nice. It makes sense, they dealt with the struggle of learning how to. I see why they want to help new skaters.",0
Skaters always have each other‚Äôs back at the park even if it‚Äôs a new skater. And his friends were probably just playing around when they made fun of him. The only people I‚Äôd say skaters don‚Äôt help with at the skate park are the kids that are snaking on skooters. I‚Äôm not saying all skooters are bad u can hit rlly cool tricks on them it‚Äôs just that there are kids like that.,0

"I know this is meant in a light-hearted way, but it really rubs me the wrong way to say ""bad mood is not allowed"" in any context. Wholesomeness is not tied to your mood.

I made something similar for an algebra class. My buddy and I were notorious for not paying attention and scrambling to pass. The final was heavy on formulas so we were allowed a 3x5. I spent 2 days scouring for every formula we might need and he spent 2 hours duplicating my card. We both got As. We had to turn in our cards with the test. Teacher wrote nice job on the card. She did not like us so I took that as high praise.,0

"I read about something like this. The poor kid never realized that although the cheat sheet was allowed, a magnifying glass was not.",0
"There's only a few times that I used cheat sheets for actual cheating.
1st in high school were I wrote pieces of content on my desk and my friends desks because the material was filled with details and it was just a pass out fail anyway.
2nd time in college, when I write about all formulae and solution steps in the data sheet we are allowed to use.

Both times, I didn't need to actually peek. Turns out I've an excellent short term memory and the act of writing what needs to be memorized down, was enough to memorize them.",0

"Years ago, hell, decades, when I got clean from heroin addiction, I felt very self-conscious about my track marks. I obviously don't wear makeup, but knew women used concealer and cover up stuff, so I walked into a Dillard's makeup section and an employee asked if she could help me.

I told her I needed some kind of powder or concealer and she said she needed to know the person's skin tone. I think she thought I was buying a gift for a girlfriend or something. 

I said, ""It's for me. I need to cover up these track marks"" and held out my arms.

Her face went from shock to horror to pity to the most supportive determination in the course of a few seconds. 

She said, ""That's awesome! Good for you! Leave that past behind! This is your new beginning and we're going to find the perfect concealer for you!""

Damn, I almost broke down crying! She was a godsend. I can't thank her -- but in her honor, I'm thanking you.

THANK YOU! For what you did for that kid, for all the good you do.",0

The boy in this was curious and the grandpa had to make a choice and quick. He chose to ignore whatever he was told in the past and supported the boys curiousity and creativity.

"Back when I was a green eyed kid, starting my first proper job (good old innocent days).. I used to catch a train starting at my station (Thane to Dadar if it helps any Bombay redditors).

There were a bunch of much older men who all caught the same train and knew each other very well. They'd chit chat, catch up about each other's work and then get off at random stops. Clearly they knew each other just because their commute was the same. I've always been a weird shy person so I'd stick to my corner seat, maybe smile or politely acknowledge the guys I saw daily and mostly doze off / chat with my girlfriend. 

Atleast 10 times in my 2.5 years of commute they've nudged me politely when my stop came as they could clearly see me fast asleep at 7:30 am. The fact that they'd look out for a random guy who wouldn't even talk much to them, meant a lot!

Homologous¬†chromosomes are two pieces of DNA within a¬†diploid¬†organism¬†which carry the same genes, one from each parental source.

In simpler terms, both of your parents provide a complete genome. Each parent provides the same 23 chromosomes, which encode the same genes. So, our cells carry 46 total chromosomes, in two copies. However, each homologous¬†chromosome¬†can provide a different version of each¬†gene. Two versions of each gene create more variety, lower the detrimental effects of negative mutations, and generally stabilize a¬†population.

Homologous Chromosome Function

Two Versions of Each Gene

Diploid organisms, like humans, carry two copies of the genome in each one of their cells. Having two copies of each chromosome, called homologous chromosomes, helps increase both the variety and stability of a¬†species. While each homologous chromosome carries the same genes, they can carry different versions of the gene. Different versions of a gene are called¬†alleles.

This means that your cells will typically produce 2 versions of every protein encoded by the DNA. Some versions will work better than others. Further, the combination of good and bad proteins produces different phenotypic effects that increase the variety within a population. Some alleles have a dominant/recessive relationship, in which the dominant gene is the only one that shows. Others have more complex relationships, and different combinations of alleles can produce vastly different effects on an organism. This is important because variety helps populations survive in the face of environmental changes.

Homologous Recombination

Lastly, homologous chromosomes take part in a process known as¬†homologous recombination¬†during the formation of gametes. This process is also known as ‚Äúcrossing over‚Äù, because parts of the homologous chromosomes are exchanged when they come into close contact. The chromosomes contain the same genes, which are generally the same length and size. These sections can easily be transferred between chromosomes. The image below shows recombination:

ÔøºMeiotic recombination for chromosome 1

In this image, each chromosome has already been replicated in preparation for¬†meiosis. However, two of the chromatids have exchanged genetic material. This process is extremely important for the creation and maintenance of variety within a population. For instance, if red is the paternal chromosome and blue is maternal, the genes they carry will no longer be linked. Just because your father had blue¬†eyes¬†and black hair does not mean you will automatically inherit these traits. Homologous recombination ensures that traits are randomly mixed together, from both parental sources.

Homologous Chromosome Examples

In a Simple Organism

The image below shows a simple organism. This organism is diploid, but only has a 1 pair of chromosomes. These are homologous chromosomes, because they carry the same genes. However, they can carry different alleles of each gene, shown by their internal pattern. This organism can reproduce asexually, simply by duplicating the DNA and dividing the¬†cell. In this case, the organism remains¬†haploid. This is shown in the top portion of the diagram.

ÔøºChromosomes in¬†mitosis¬†and meiosis

The bottom portion of the image shows the production of gametes for¬†sexual reproduction. Meiosis is the process used to create gametes. Meiosis creates haploid cells, which can be combined with gametes from another organism to form a new diploid organism. Haploid organisms have only one copy of the DNA, therefore, they do not have homologous chromosomes. When these gametes pair up and join together, they will again be in the same cell with a new homologous pair.

In Humans

As with the simple hypothetical organism above, humans also have homologous chromosomes. One half of each pair comes from our mother, while the other comes from our father. These chromosomes are carried in the haploid¬†gamete¬†cells, sperm and eggs. When a sperm meets an egg,¬†fertilization¬†occurs and a diploid organism is formed. This¬†zygote, like the organism above, will divide many times to create all of the cells of our body. Each cell in your body, then, contains 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes, or 46 total chromosomes. The image below shows a human karyotype, or visualization of the condensed chromosomes. Notice how each pair has a similar shape and dye pattern. This is because each of these homologous chromosomes carries the same genes.

ÔøºHuman male karyotype

As we become sexually mature, the human body starts to produce and release gametes. These gametes have been reduced to haploid cells, after first being mixed up and recombined in different arrangements. This means that children will have a mixture of traits not necessarily seen in their parents or grandparents. In fact, some combinations of traits will be completely new thanks to homologous chromosomes and how they help us reproduce.

Look at this happy this gecko is with his gecko toy,0
He thinks he's the daddy,0
"Is it just me that thinks geckos might not actually be smiling bc I've never seen a gecko that's not smiling, what if it's just it's face that's like that?",0
Proud papa.,0
Ok but this gecko toy looks pretty friggin realistic next to a real one,0
"I have to go to college very very soon, however I'm not allowed to bring my gecko with me, so I had to give them away to someone else to take care of them. Is very sad to see him go, but I know that he's in a very very good place üòÑ",0

"Ahh, this is good. If you have things, and you're not using them anymore, give them to people who will use them. Or sell for a tiny price to preserve their pride. 

There is a story called ""Everyday Use"" by Alice Walker, and it's about deep stuff, but one of the mini-themes is the idea that ITEMS are meant to be USED by people who will love and cherish them. These items are going to be so happy now. Not to mention the kids! This is how the world should be.",0

"I was at the grocery store one time and the lady at the cashier in front of me started crying hysterically.  She had $45 worth of groceries but when she went to pay she had no money.  Apparently she had just got paid and had $300 to buy a month‚Äôs worth of groceries, but she lost it all before reaching the cashier.

I couldn‚Äôt just watch that happen, so I took $50 from the $300 I had just found in the parking lot and paid for her groceries, because I believe when you have good luck, you should share it.",0
I hope she lets him smash,0
So humble too...,0
That's more than what he would have gotten if he traded it in to GameStop so Win Win!,0
‚ÄúAnd then I decided I had to post on Reddit for clout because the endless gratitude of 6 children and a mother who will always appreciate and smile at me isn‚Äôt enough and I have to validate my good deeds with appreciation from thousands of strangers.‚Äù,0

"I know some chicks who do stuff like this. It's always so strange. The cute women/woman takes notice of the loner, bullied or handicapped person. The strange thing wasn't the act, some people really just care. But the pride they emited was often... demeaning. Like bringing a puppy home or nursing a baby bird.

Which brings me to thinking as to why they brought a guy over to be kind, then proceed to take a picture of him and post it by themselves. This is so far only self promotion. Of course i might be wrong, I have just seen this so many times. And the dude might not care. That's also the thing. If they profit and he don't mind, they basically just used him BECAUSE he was alone and that would suck more than just leaving him alone.

I should take a nap.

""With what has been released by the CIA we know that due to the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'√©tat and the installation of militarized leadership, more than 100,000 Guatemalan citizens have been killed. The U.S. utilized forms of physical and psychological torture to break down Guatemalans into submission.

The goal of the PBSuccess was to instill fear and terror throughout the Guatemalans. The Americans believed that by creating terror within Guatemala, it would in turn disassemble the Guatemalan government.[1] The coup was articulated to appear as if the Soviets had been at fault for the chaos.""

True for each & every person reading this.,0
That's gotta be amongst the less motivating sentences I've ever read. Makes it sound like you're choosing between two equally bad things and attending his funeral is just slightly worse.,0
"Yea and when you open up, they say you're doing  all that for attention and be like ""oh that's sad"" ""that sucks""",0
"Honestly, I don‚Äôt think this is helpful. Or wholesome. If Suicide was about ‚Äúno one cares‚Äù -  socially stable, high functioning people would never take their own life. Stopping the pain, the overwhelming and incessant pain, is often the only thing on one‚Äôs mind. So one conversation with you is just going to fix a lifetime of challenges and the overwhelming blackness? It‚Äôs tone deaf to what living with mental health challenges is actually like. Day in, day out. 9 years. I‚Äôm in recovery, but I work with people every day who would rather be dead. It‚Äôs just not this simple.",0

K well ur not exactly invited,0
when you put it like that...,0
"So my life is a would you rather, makes sense. If you care about people considering suicide, care about them, don't make them feel like their life is an inconvenience for you, their life is not your choice. Love them unconditionally, and make sure they know that until those thoughts go away.",0
Telling my story to a million people won‚Äôt help me get better...,0
"I don't think advice to suicidal people should revolve around the feelings of others.  I don't see why someone should keep living and suffering just because *I* would be sad if they died.  Surely it'd be better for them to no longer be suffering?  I'd prefer advice about how things might get better *for them*, and leave my own selfish feelings out of it.  

Just my opinion.",0
Yeah I already have plans that day.,0
Bold of you to assume youre getting an invite,0
No one here would attend my funeral.,0
"Seeing alot of haters in the comments and I would like to vouch for this post and say I found it wholesome. Not everyone who thinks of suicide thinks of themself as useless or no good to anyone but many are in alot of pain because of trauma and depression and don't know how to let their emotions out because most people keep their feelings suppressed (MEN AND WOMEN). It's ok to ask for help and don't try and disappear to stop the pain because people want to help you just need to let them know you need help. That is easier said than done and is an ongoing struggle for many people which is why I found this post wholesome. ‚ù§Ô∏è Many have been there you are not alone, it's ok to ask for help.",0
"Bet, ur invited to my funeral",0
I love ya allü•∫üíóüíó,0

Thanks,0
"Yeah sure, at least in the funeral you gonna remember the person and not ignore them in their indirect calls for help, till its too late. 

If you want to stop these things from happening, talk to your friends, the ones that suddenly disappeared, the ones that had problems and you just forgot about, the ones that broke up with their SO and can't just ""get over it"", or the ones that just refuse to go outside on their own. 

It's easy to break the downward spiral, someone else just has to give that little bump to move the person into a new direction.",0
Good thing you don't actually have to do either...I guess?,0

The kid who sat in front of me, who I only knew from that class, said, ""Oh, that's Marty. He's just tired today, but he's cool."" The teacher didn't say anything else about it and moved on.

I'm not sure if I'd call it a compliment exactly, but he sounded completely genuine and it made me feel really good that he'd spoken up for me.

One told me it was a great way for them to earn money because of how hard it can be to find a job but Uber/Lyft didn't care, they even made it easier to work with passengers by notifying them when a driver was hearing impaired.

"I've met 2 old playmates from one game in another 7 years later. Its easier to do when the game genres are niche and naturally a smaller playerbase to begin with. Something as huge as Halo and Valorant, though, is impressive. Kinda funny that both have improved/stagnated at the same rate to be in the same elo",0
Such a wholesome moment. I had a friend on Halo 3 that helped me beat the legendary campaign for E.O.D. armor. I've been searching for nearly a decade with no luck. I just hope he's getting by alright and still enjoying himself.,0

Have you considered that between this image and a previous post you made elsewhere, you may have doxed yourself?

I'm not a complete creeper, but just putting the thought out there.

"I saw her story the other day.  She went to a dentist who pulled out all her teeth for something that didn‚Äôt require full removal.  Dentist then fitted her with dentures that didn‚Äôt fit.  Like, they really didn‚Äôt fit.  This dentist here heard her story and replaced her teeth free of charge.",0

This procedure takes weeks to complete. Not like he had a spare set of dentures in storage.  Good reaction video though.,0
"The hug she gave him at the end was so sweet. It must've been a huge emotional weight off her shoulders when she got them, plus it probably makes it easier to eat, too! I'm happy for her",0

Okay now I'm fuckin crying üò≠üíó,0

Can relate a little. Currently working though orthodontist guided aligners for the last 22 weeks with about a dozen or so to go. I'm pretty obsessed with my teeth and being able to afford/fix them as an adult feels so amazing after a youth of bad teeth,0
The dentist looks almost as happy as she does. So many people go through life really never knowing if they've done anything that matters to anyone. It's got to be so fulfilling to just know for certain that you've brought true joy to someone.,0

"Amazing. You know, it‚Äôs actually rather surprising to see how many prominent individuals took a stand for human rights during the middle of the last century. this is a 1964 sitcom, so it started smack in the middle of the civil rights movement? Maybe a towards the end? Yet you very explicitly have somebody on TV saying ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre **BLACK** or yellow, or blah blah blah.‚Äù

People watching at that time sound have absolutely gotten what he just said. It‚Äôs just like when Mr Rogers shared a pool with the black police officer, although that example is decidedly more explicit. 

Such a powerful message to put into a show.",0

"That‚Äôs really fitting since, as you may know, Mary Shelly was a *big time* vegetarian. Frankenstein‚Äôs monster (whilst he is a murderer) does at points express moments of great empathy and compassion, and it is in one of these points where he expresses how he is a vegetarian - in these moments, the reader is lead to believe Frankenstein‚Äôs monster is really capable of reform he expresses these vegetarian sentiments, therein portraying vegetarianism in a similar light. The book‚Äôs message of compassion then, being reused in the show, is a nice touch.

Edit: In the original version of this comment, i made a big error about the plot of the book in calling Frankenstein‚Äôs monster ‚Äúa gentle giant‚Äù, sorry! As someone pointed out below, Frankenstein‚Äôs monster is absolutely not a ‚Äúgentle giant‚Äù (though he is at times sentimental)",0

"My doggo Patches is a Jack Russell. We inherited her from my cousin Margo, who passed from congestive heart failure 3 years ago (but really it was just schizophrenia killing her indirectly, it does that). I miss my cousin and I love my dog. She's old but she's a good doggo.",0

This is how I got my German Shepherd.  We only went cause he was listed as already adopted so we figured we would actually just be looking and maybe donating. Turns out he was returned.

It makes me really happy that they are still together 22 years later, married, with two children. I stayed with them and met their kids a few summers ago.    
   
When they asked me how long I'd known their moms I said, ""A long time; more than half of our lives ago.""      
Her mom said, ""It was a long time ago. But summer camp friends are forever.""    
Their eldest daughter spent more than a hour telling me about her last summer camp adventure, and I read the other one to sleep. I am happy for them, but am sad that the Girl Scouts sold the camp where we all met before their daughters were old enough to go there themselves.",0

In high school i was known as the garlic dip guy since i took garlic dip for every meal in school (I live in sweden so the meals are free) At graduation i got a shirt with with the garlic dip recipie and a big jar of garlic dip... I ate that garlic dip in 2 days,0
"This reminds me of the school i went to for junior and senior year. We had larger program for special needs then most schools ive seen so they were a prevalent sight around campus. Our varsity football and basketball teams were full of some of the sweetest guys ive known and they always used to have some of the SpEd kids come and hype up the games at pep rallies and sit with them at lunch, or really anything that they could use as an excuse to let them join in so they knew they had people that cared about em and it showed me that friendship completely transcends differences between people either physically or how they think. I remember one of the kids, his name was Chance. He had down syndrome, that didn‚Äôt stop him from from wanting to be the life of the party and just spread kindness around to everyone he saw, he is one of the most wholesome and genuine people ive ever meet in my life. Its sad to me that people dont always get the chance to meet people like that just because the see them as different and don‚Äôt engage with them. 
Hope this memory of mine will have you go out and just be nice to your neighbors and other people around you ‚úåüèª",0

Edit/disclaimer: this is by no means the fault of anyone in the disabled community. I‚Äôm just saying just bcz they‚Äôre nice one member of the disabled community doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt total dicks",0
My high school was like that. Kids who were disabled or mentally challenged were usually well liked. Everyone kind of rallied around them and made them part of their group.,0

Seeing girls like this make me feel even more insecure about my own face,0
"Even if you don‚Äôt find this woman attractive, are the comments about that really necessary?",0
Using make up for the most beautiful face seems kinda like cheating,0
We could all use a little dick in our lives,0
"Ya'll realize that this ""The most handsome/beautiful face in world"" is based on popularity votes, right? Of course we're not gonna see much ""unique beauty"". More than half of those men and women are celebs that we know or celebs from other countries. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, sure- but do ya'll really have to put her down? Also to everyone calling her plastic- she's natural... yes, she is. Why do people like to assume automatically that someone is plastic? Is it jealousy? Or to make yourself feel better? Or you just love to judge. Ya'll dont even know her and dont care to- therefore judge without merit. If ya'll can judge her like this- I wonder how you treat others from first glance and behind their backs.
Her name is Yael Shelbia, a rising supermodel from Israel. My ex met her and family- they're great people. She is a sweet girl. 
She looks fine with or without makeup, ladies. Yes, you ladies especially because as a female myself- it's mainly other females who say, ""Too much makeup or fake etc"" quit trying to be ""pick me"" girls and act like ya'll hate makeup when you love makeup. Makeup ain't a sin. Yael looks fine with or without makeup. You wear less makeup or none at all? Good for you. You dont like or cant wear makeup? That's you and no one should shame you. Therefore dont put other women down for wearing makeup. 
Other girls are prettier? No shit theres tons of people on this planet who look uniquely beautiful in their own way- but this TC Candler Beauty vote thing ain't featuring everyone on the planet or the girls going to your school. Not everyone will find her attractive, but dont put her down. 
Edit: grammar.",0

I‚Äôm just imaging it‚Äôs a shared account and Mrs.Freemantle is living her best life!,0
"Who is her ""male counterpart""? Is she part of a famous couple or something? I don't track celebrities, especially Instagram ""celebrities"".",0
"Oh my gosh, if you don't like how she looks then, Okay! Keep it to yourself. Just because you think she looks ""derpy"" or ""fake"" or whatever, doesn't mean that it's okay to say that. Like, y'all are so quick to judge people. Nobody knows how she is behind the screen. Maybe she doesn't like how she looks and so that's why she posts pictures. Maybe she wants somebody to tell her she's pretty in a way that she can actually believe it. ***We don't know***, and we probably never will! Like the ""she's not actually that pretty"" comments are unnecessary. Also, if you're confident in yourself, that's great, amazing, astounding. Just because you're confident doesn't mean you drag others down. ""Oh I'm so pretty and I know that bc this person is so ugly."" Go eat some mascara or something. Maybe you are pretty on the outside, but if you say something like that we'll know that you don't have the personality.

Okay I'm done

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

Hey it is something big.  It has to start somewhere right? Hey if you have a slip don't think oh I messed up I might as well give up. There is no shame in falling down.  It's getting back up that is the most important. I wish you all the best on your journey.,0
"I don't know anything about you but I can tell you this: both of my parents were alcoholics. My father started drinking when I was a toddler, my mother after divorce when I was a teenager. 

I would have done \*everything\* as in absolutely everything for them to have a poster like that. My father didn't make it, but my mother is sober now for 25 years. I understand how hard this journey is for you and you can be proud for every single day! 

Keep going, you can do this!",0
I expect an update,0
"Remember to reach out on hard days. I fight depression and anxiety one of my favorite sayings is depression lies. So change it to work for you. Alcohol lies. Also you are not alone. If all else fails you can reach out to me. I will be happy to listen and let you talk it out. You have made the hardest few steps. *You admitted to yourself there was a problem.
*You told others there was a problem. *You made the choice to change. *You started the process to change. Guess what you got this.

"I went a full month in January sober. Was in the same boat were I hadn't gone longer then 24 hours in as far as I could remember. The first 2 weeks were the hardest, first 2 days had te shakes. Got tremendously easier after that. Good luck! You got this!!",0
You go! I went last year from 8 drinks/day to zero. After a couple weeks I realized I feel way better without booze in the evening and waking up the next morning. It gets easier and better every day.,0

"Start building a support group. It doesn't have to be AA, it can be friends who know what you are going through whose job it is would be to help you be distracted on hard days.

Don't be afraid to reach out for help. This isn't a single player game.",0
Fuck yeah man keep going!!,0
"Good job bro.  I just passed 6 months myself after drinking for about 35 years.  It gets easier and easier and then you realize (eventually) that you don't miss it at all.  Say goodbye to the shakes and dragging ass the whole next day.   Trust me, you'll sleep like a baby soon enough.",0
"New beginnings are beautiful, and I thank you for posting now.  The most important thing about getting/being sober posts to me are the people they inspire.  As amazing as the long-term success stories are, they can be daunting to the individual that's still using, or the individual struggling through their first few days of recovery.  The hardest time is right when the doubt first sets in.  It's also the best time to reach out for support. 

&#x200B;

You've already accomplished the hardest part.  The decision to quit drinking is absolutely something to be proud of.  You've even done the second-hardest part early and reached out to a supportive community.  There will always be someone that understands what you're going through, albeit through the lens of their own experience.  Your decision to share your experience early on increases your odds of success by so much, and it's brilliant that you've done so publicly.  

&#x200B;

I love seeing how your bravery has caused people to gather around you, both for support and to offer strength - now that reddit knows you're taking control of your life, we're going to want updates!

"Well done you! I have no experience with things like this (too young) but can only imagine how hard it must be, Keep going, and when you reclaim your life in triumph you will look back and see just how well you did! :) Best of luck with the rest of your journey!",0

We did not meet in person before I had to move.  We both dated others..  Occasionally we corresponded via email and around 2 years later discovered that we were both single again.  We decided to meet in person even though we lived in different cities now 2 hours apart.  6 months later we were married.  18 months after that we had our daughter.  15 years later we are still married and have a great life.",0

"Actually happened to my 9yr old stepdaughter last year. No replies no one turned up. We saved the day by telling her her friends (only 4 invited as she has ASD and poor social communication skills) were probably so worried that the party would be the better than their own so they didnt want to go. She loves it. She told everyone it was the best party ever and her friends were too jealous to come (we booked bowling and mcd). Luckily she has mental age of alot younger so didnt feel the embarrassment.
No party booked for next month. Just us 4 family having the best day out.",0
"When I was in elementary school, the awkward girl who was clearly poor invited the whole class to her birthday. Proper invites hand-written by her for 28 kids. I wasn't feeling well and didn't want to go, but compromised with my mom to bring me so I could drop off the gift.

Got there about 10 mins late and nobody else showed up. I looked at my mom and she looked at me and we both knew I had to stay. Had a great time but felt so bad for her. And I was so angry at my friends and classmates. That family worked so hard to make that party happen and all the little dipshits RSVPed but didn't show.",0
Lovely brother and friends.,0
"This actually sort of happened to me. My family was in the process of moving and we had to stay in our summer hut for about two months. I had just turned 6 and my sister was about to turn 9 and we decided to have a shared birthday party, invite all our friends. We only needed one cake with 6 or 9 frosted on it depending on where you looked at it from. My sister's friends started coming over, not a big deal for them. My sister and I are super close now but around that time she was trying to become a teenager and wanted nothing to do with me. So she and her friends went off somewhere and wouldn't let me come. Then one of my friends came. And that was it. I assume it's because our summer hut was far from the city and not every parent is up for that drive only to leave their 6 year old outside their supervision in the middle of nowhere for an hour, but it was a real bummer for me. I ended up seeing that party as my sister's birthday and not mine at all. I would have loved to be with the older kids for just a second.",0
It happened to me on my 18th birthday. Over 30 people said they would come. I even arranged it on a night they usually go out anyway. 1 by 1 messages trickled through on the night while I was out waiting. Only 1 work colleague showed. I spent the night crying in beer gardens. Hurts so hard even as an adult. Haven't arranged anything for a birthday since.,0
"Very very wholesome. 

Sidenote: Why do people think it's ok to agree to attending an event and then not show up? This happens to me as an adult ALL THE TIME. Don't agree to something if you aren't sure. Gmail calendar invites literally have a ""Maybe attending"" option. Click Maybe if you're not sure. Don't click Yes and then not show up without even having the decency to let the organizer know. People are rude! /rant",0
"So, I think it was second grade. I didn‚Äôt have many friends and this kid in my class sent out birthday invitations to the whole class. I didn‚Äôt really know him very well but I had never been invited to a birthday party before! I was so stoked! 

I begged my parents to take me to Kmart so I could get him a gift because, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do when you get invited to a birthday party, right? I got him some kind of slime that was in a Rocket container and had little rubber planets in it. -I remember because it was really hard not to keep it for myself.
Anyway, I took so long picking out the present that I was fifteen minutes late. No one had shown up yet and he looked like he had been crying. His parents looked so relieved, thinking back on it.
We ended up having a great time, watching Rocket Power and eating pizza and jumping on the trampoline. I thought we were gonna be bffs after that.
The next week at school, he hard core ignored me and kind of turned into a bully. I was always so confused, but looking back on it, he was probably embarrassed that I witnessed a low moment in his life.

I don‚Äôt remember his name or anything but, that experience always stick with me.",0

"Back in elementary, this happened to me. I was shy and very very sensitive (the level of sensitive to start cryinf and hugging the teacher for not getting an exercise correct.) I turned 7 and invited about 14 girls from my class. They all said they were coming and we had that confirmed by their parents. No one came and no one said they couldn't come. I spend my birthday crying in my mothers arms after helping her prepare 7 different party games she thought of herself, bake 3 cakes and make cupcakes. 
We also set up a movie night. 
Ever since then, I stopped celebrating my birthday with friends. I'm now 14 and still scared that no one will show up again if I tried. This experience scarred me and will most likely never let me go again. It made me scared of becoming friends with others because I was scared they would just leave and not tell me, I can't look into the faces of people my age anymore.

Oh how sweet life is.",0
"This happened to me when I was turning 7. I didn‚Äôt invite my whole class but I invited like 10 people, only one showed up. It was heart breaking and I have never had a birthday celebration since (I‚Äôm 26!). My parents didn‚Äôt care and made pretty much zero effort for the party and didn‚Äôt bother trying to comfort me. I was just a sad, lonely and unloved child. If I could go back in time I‚Äôd just give myself a big hug. Makes me sad to think about still, I was really scarred by that experience and always had difficulty making friends. Parents, if your child doesn‚Äôt have any friends *that‚Äôs a problem and you should make an effort to help them. *",0

"Happened to my 26-year-old boy for the last couple of years. He's mentally handicapped, still very much a little kid, and begins planning his birthday party (and sending invites) MONTHS in advance. He also doesn't understand why his old school friends don't all stop by for the party. I mean, he *invited* them, didn't he? So, after the first time it was a let-down, my wife & I have let him plan how he sees fit, but we've planned alternate festivities, too, just in case. 

My heart breaks for him, but at this point it feels like the best thing I can do is just help him manage expectations.",0

"I was the oldest, no one ever came to my birthdays. In fact, I was rarely allowed to throw BDay parties because it upset my younger sister and my mom didn‚Äôt want to buy that many presents. Because she would buy me something I didn‚Äôt want and my sister something she wanted. 
The story behind this is, my mom was an only child and she took all sorts of fertility drugs to have my sister who literally took the uterus out with her. 
So I was just the first child. Not the precious miracle child. 
Thus I spent a ton of time being blamed for all of my younger sisters shortcomings because ‚Äúit‚Äôs your job to teach and guide her‚Äù so my sister would sneak out and I got grounded. Thus my birthday wasn‚Äôt ever about me, and most of the time every other holiday was the same way.
Finally got them both out of my life and found a healthy relationship, with an amazing sweet guy. We celebrated my birthday, and they got me surprise presents and my favorite food. I love him and I cried big time. Anyway happy ending for me.",0

My friend gave a kidney to her sister. It's actually incredibly common. Turns out human beings are very willing to give freely of their lives. Minimum wage is proof.,0
This story has been making the rounds at least since the mid to late 80's.  It was used by a pastor to describe the love of Christ.,0
"This story is a bit suspect because O- is the universal donor. If hospitals keep an abundance of any kind of blood on hand, it‚Äôs O-",0
\*insert soluting meme here\*,0
Just precious!!!!,0
I finally see the original of this! I‚Äôve seen the one where someone swapped ‚Äúthey are both fine‚Äù with ‚Äúthey both died‚Äù so many times.,0
Tha was not supposed to happen,0
"I don't want to be that party pooper or anything but:

As a medical student doing ungodly hours at hospitals and also a little extra research to confirm my suspicions . I can tell you that this would never happen.

O neg is so common and hospitals always have an abundance of it.

If not,

Patients have to be at least 16 years old to donate blood so they would probably ask people in the waiting room

Plus , blood will then be tested in labs before being transfused.

Cute story though not gonna lie",0

This is sad as fuck,0
The fact that he even got convicted makes me believe the judicial system is flawed so much that an innocent man can go to jail for 25 years yet the person that falsely accused him can get away with it without any punishment.,0
"How is this wholesome? Fucking guy spent 25 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit. His life is ruined and a quarter of it is gone.

"I am curious. When a person is wrongfully accused, does prison time and then released, will the state give them compensatory money as in ""This is the average salary you would have gotten if you worked those 25 years"".

"Not to be *that guy*, but I'm gonna be *that guy*. Are they going to do literally anything to actually make a difference in him adjusting back to normal life? I sure as fuck hope his record is wiped of this shit so he can get a job almost fucking *anywhere*.

Regardless, congrats to that dude. Glad that it appears he has a good welcoming party.",0

Jesus thats a long time he spent 25 FUCKING YEARS for a crime he didn't do took long enough,0
I hope they gave him some kind of compensation. This guy lost 25 years of his life,0
"Something similar happened in Poland recently. An innocent man was sentenced to 25 years for rape and murder of a teenage girl. He was acquitted after spending 18 years in prison. He got a payout of approximately 3 mln USD.

Get a friend you can hug and who hugs you back: priceless.,0
I genuinely support this being a more normalized thing,0
I support all homies cuddling on the reg,0
Weird that they filmed it but whatever. I‚Äôm glad to see homies hugging. Expressing physical affection between friends is healthy and good.,0
"Got the *homie*?

Das good *homie*",0
The fucking best,0
Ok this is cool and all. But shoes in bed??,0
Just guys being dudes,0
Cuddle puddle! ‚ù§,0

That's what the homies are. They got your back,0
Non-toxic masculinity at its finest!!!!,0
***ATTACK HUGS EVERYONE IN THE COMMENTS***,0
Ain't nothing wholesome about shoes on the fucking bed,0
"i am bi but something about this still makes me uncomfortable. 

i know its trauma or just growing up in a shitty environment but cuddling with my homies just doesnt seem like an enjoyable thing for me. physical affection is really hard, affection in general is hard. i held one of my best friends after pulling his head out of a noose and we both just cried together (i stopped him mid attempt) i hugged him and we both cried for like 10 minutes and it was still uncomfortable lol idk wtf is wrong with us. its hard to work through.",0
Good friends are such wonderful people to come by in life truly. This is very sweet,0
"Man, these are my boys right here. Never afraid of a hug or w.e. it takes to take care of the fam! Keep being awesome guys!",0
"This is the difference between the homies and the boys.

Homies always got your back. Doesn‚Äôt have to be gay to show affection. People need to normalize men being treated like humans",0
This is the best thing I e seen in a really long time.  I love it so much.,0
Bro if you don‚Äôt snuggle wit the homies don‚Äôt even talk to me,0
My 20-something son has buds just like this. I love it!!! Things have changed foe the better since I was in school. Everyone needs a hug now and then!,0
I wish I could ask a homie for cuddles without being called gay.,0
How do I save this?,0

"When I was in college I had a nanny job. I used to pose a little Paddington Bear doing different activities before I picked the kids up at kindergarten. For example, sitting on a small tricycle like he was pedaling around the room.

The kids would race through the door every day to see what Paddington was up to - they thought if they were fast enough they'd catch him moving! 

But Paddington was quicker, and he would freeze in place when he heard someone coming.",0

okay i know it‚Äôs adorable and all but the way the first sentence is worded with the ‚Äòwe BRING you‚Äô instead of ‚Äòwe BROUGHT you‚Äô makes me feel like they‚Äôre peaceful aliens or something like ‚Äòwe arrive baring gifts to show we come in peace‚Äô and now im imagining aliens coming to earth to give everyone early birthday presents and my day is better,0
Why is everybody unable to see that the croc can easily eat with the side of it's mouth?,0
"This is far too unrealistic!

Crocodiles can't stick out their tongues!",0
using selfie sticks for selfies is for noobs,0

He was so happy and couldn‚Äôt stop smiling every time he looked at his flowers. Ladies, gents, and non-binary friends, give your man some flowers.

To this day I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs fully processed why I did that. I might try again with different kinds until I find out his fave flower, maybe he just wasn‚Äôt a fan of peonies!",0
I just asked my boyfriend and he said sunflower too! Because his late dad's favourite flower was sunflower.,0
"I like dandelions because of their sheer will to exist and survive anywhere, just like 3 grass blades sticking out of a crack in concrete. My favorite tree is the silver willow.",0

he was so excited and stoked on it that when he went to visit family he told his sister. she turned to her husband and asked him why he never buys her flower

we are both dudes, so her husband said he thought it was gay and wouldn't accept them and would have stopped talking to them.

imagine such fragile ideas of masculinity that flowers from another man easily threaten it so youd just reject the gift and person instead xD",0

Don't mind me....just chopping some goddamn onions,0
"That quote made me tear up. I lost two people I loved very much, it will be 2 years this fall. Our living situation and the nature of their deaths were horribly traumatic so I cant remember a lot of important details of their life. It has left a stain of heartache on my body I cant erase. And though the memories are blurry I will forever remember dancing to Disney music, little feet following close behind. I'll always remember the bedtime stories.   I'll remember the late nights up with a tummy ache forever. I'll never forget the nights we shared. Those nights have left an impression on my body I dont want to let fade. I still dream they're still here almost every night. But the best I can do is keep moving on, enjoy the happy ending I definitely deserve, and keep my tear soaked face up.",0
Probably fake because no other texts are above it,0

This reminds me of my grandma. She makes friends with everyone. She was a waitress for all her life and in her senior years while she was still healthy she worked at a restaurant where really all she did was BS with regulars. The young south American guys working in the kitchen all loved her and they used to call her on the phone to chit chat and come stop by the house to visit when she had to stop working.

Someone needs to teach this dog about chin up and face slightly forward- that way his neck won‚Äôt look fat in photos.,0
"That dog is a good boy, but the use of dogs in the police force is not only ironic with how many dogs get killed by police every day, but also literal animal abuse.",0

My day has been made. Thank you.,0
Such a happy good boy,0
Estimation of 500 dogs killed daily by officers. Max may be cute but the men with the leash certainly aren't.,0

Cops wp hand. Talk about dog whistles.,0
Fuck the police,0
"Okay starting with the standing cops, middle one was responsible for planning this, right one is fully on board with it, the left one and seated left one arin't quite sure how they got roped into this and the doggo himself has his signature look of superiority.",0
This is so cute!! I just had a birthday party for my German shepherd who turned 13. It was a lot of fun üéâ,0

Einstein wasn't bad at school. He aced every class he had. It sadly is a myth that he sucked at school.,0
"Actually, Einstein was good in school. It is a myth that he was terrible in school. However, I hope you will be successful one day.",0
I feel stupid after seeing all the other comments but Einstein was actually quite good in school,0
Einstein was good in school. There‚Äôs not anything that says that he performed poorly but good day,0

"My teddy bear is Cthulhu. Before I knew about him I saw this adorable plush I and stole it from my dad, said he protected me from my nightmares. Nowadays I refer to him as ‚Äúthe good Cthulhu‚Äù or that I am literally his god. I am the god‚Äôs god.

My parents have had him since before I was born so I can assert that is probably 25+ years old.

"I didn‚Äôt have a teddy bear, but two stuffed bunnies that hug each other. Got it when I was seven around Easter from my mom. My parents were going through a divorce at the time. Those bunnies wiped away so many tears, scared off all the scary ghost in the dark, and helped me sleep. I still have them 19 years later. They are the one stuffed animal I will never part from.",0

"My BC boy, Banksy, did this! The first time we went on a doggie date with our friends' BC, Athena, we went for a hike, followed by a trip to the dog bakery.  

Banksy refused every treat offered by the nice owner, which was then promptly eaten by Athena.  Owner became determined to tempt him to eat something, busting out higher and higher quality treats from her stores.  He finally accepted dehydrated beef lung.  

He had never, ever been picky about treats before or after.  I wondered if he had figured out a way to game the system and get so many ""free drinks"" for his date.",0

"Sometimes breakups serve us well. I had an ex who dumped me the day before Valentine‚Äôs Day. I‚Äôm a caricaturist so I took my miserable ass down to Las Vegas Blvd and drew for tips all day. Like 16 hours, I had puffy eyes and a tear stained face for the better part of the day and I definitely lost it whenever old couples that were still in love got drawn together, or people getting married that day.   But I Made $1700 in pity tips that day, by the end I was fueled solely on bitterness and Starbucks. But bought a round of drinks for a bunch of strangers that night.",0

This happens a lot here in Mumbai. At least twice a month I happen to see someone bring underprivileged children for a snack to McDonald's. It's great.,0
Looks like from Indian subcontinent... üëèüëèüëè,0
This makes me happy tbh,0
i love some humanity,0
"should've bought them fishing rods, or a bag of rice that would feed them for a month.


all McDonald's does is make you thirsty due to the high salt content, and maybe give you the shits.",0
Reminds me of that time when Donald Trump bought Mcdonalds for all the college athletes visiting the White House.,0
Well are they poor kids or his kids?,0
Bruh I'm not saying this isn't wholesome and kind but please be responsible with your money and don't burn it all to take children to mcdonalds,0

That is very wholesome:) kinda made my day.,0
Thank you I‚Äôm so ashamed by my belly,0
thanks I needed that,0
I once weighed in at 500 lbs. My stretch marks remind me physically of the mental problems I came through and how I am not that person anymore. My wife thinks I am adorable and she married up and I still blush when she compliments me after three years of marriage.,0
"As a man, getting compliments is amazing, it‚Äôs rare to get them, during lockdown I shaved my head and grew a full beard out, friends and colleagues have been complementing me about and I feel so much for confident. Those compliments about my new look made me genuinly happy and have a really positive attitude. It made me compliment alot of other people aswell",0
"But!!!

Please do what you want that makes you comfortable in your own skin but DONT do it for other people!

Do it for you.",0
"We aren‚Äôt that different, men and women. Think of how you feel about the sex you‚Äôre attracted to. They don‚Äôt have to be perfect and tone. That‚Äôs how the other sex feels too (assuming straight).

With media we forget sometimes and think the other sex (assuming straight) strongly prefers perfection. Women think men want big tits and butts, men think women want huge dicks. But most people, even when they like those things, don‚Äôt care nearly as much as what we think. Would it be cool to be with a girl with big boobs, sure. Would it be cool to be with a really fit guy, sure. But none of us REALLY care. 

It‚Äôs all blown out of proportion. Think about how you feel and remember most people feel the same way.",0
People who don‚Äôt love themselves much should see this to realize how much more they matter,0

"I'm so devoid of positive comments, that I read that and instantly went like ""that's a lie. They're only saying that to sound nice but wouldn't actually act on it if a short acne filled guy came up to them."" It may be unreasonable to think that, but it was my first instinct ngl",0

"i am moderately in shape, few love handles here and there with a belly. kind of a dad bod. and for a while i was happy with that. but recently enough, i started getting stretch marks. a few on my lower torso and waist but most vibrant ones are on my shoulders , armpits and into my chest. its really kicked my self conciousness  embarassingly high. but seeing posts like this really make me feel good. like a second to breathe and smile about what i cant change. its really great seeing body positivity for us guys of all shapes and sizes",0

I still got fired when my manager saw it on the camera somehow and she even tried to press charges but the cops told her it was fair game since the dumpster was on shared property with the rest of the mall and there were no locks or anything. It's nice to know there's an opposite manager out there somewhere.",0

"As a grandma myself, I‚Äôm sure she was onto you but loved the ritual as much as you did!  My late husband and I raised my granddaughter together and he had a ritual he called ‚Äúthe family dive‚Äù, where her would put his hands above his head and pretend to dive into bed. It was silly, and involved lots of tickling and giggling!  He has been gone 3 years now, but it is a sweet memory for both of us!",0

Ofcourse I can tell when she is awake but she'll get the kisses and cuddles anyway, it's more for me than for her anyway. Just a few more years and she'll be a teenager and probably hate me. So have to get as many kisses and cuddles as I can",0

"Reminds me of a customer when I worked at Waffle House everyone called Old Bill. He would come in daily for eggs and grits with coffee.

I saw some people bringing in gifts and they told me that it was Old Bill's birthday, so I made a couple of phone calls and got some coworkers to show up with cake mix and frosting we worked out how to make a cake in an egg skillet.

My boss was not amused but went along with it since it was for Old Bill. Eventually he fell and had to be put in a nursing home so we took turns bringing him breakfast every morning because he in his own words hated ""the shit they call food here."" We even bought and brought him packs of coffee grounds so he could continue enjoying Waffle House coffee.

Sadly he passed away about a year later and during his wake the entire crew got together and divided that morning shift up so we could all go and pay our respects to our favorite customer.",0
Aw not even just a cake if that's another worker bringing in that gift bag ü•∫ my heart.,0
I‚Äôm here for all of this. Living for her reaction.,0
"I've had some wonderful regular customers in my time. There was G this lovely older lady that would gift the people she saw most at the restaurant a wallet with $10 in it for Christmas. We all doted on her and she loved every second of it. She would always sit so patiently with her coffee while we made a fresh slice pie for her. She'd always tip the person that brought over her food by sticking a dollar in a napkin and tucking it into your hand like a drug deal. 

Then there was B who was a grumpy old retired cop turned grave digger. Had the biggest heart behind that tough exterior. He unofficially adopted a girl as his granddaughter because his neighbors (her parents) weren't the best people. He would bring her in and spoil her. They'd play the claw machine and wipe us out lol. He also gave me $50 when I got pregnant to help me out with the baby. I made him give me a hug on my last day. 

The most cherished memory though was a thank you note a homeless couple wrote me. I don't wanna get too into that because what I did was only small but I did more than they asked of me and they appreciated it more than I thought they would when I was doing it. We were all crying and we hugged before they left. I told the guy I wanted to help him get a job and talked to my boss about it the next day but he never came back. I hope they're okay. 

Back onto the post...that woman is so darling and I would love her to bits also.",0

" So how'd this work out for the FX and costume teams? The second and third Matrix movies earned more than **$1.2 billion** at the worldwide box office. When it was all said and done, Keanu reportedly ended up giving away an estimated **$75 million dollars**. ¬†Each member of these teams received $1 million dollars per person, instantly making them all millionaires.¬†But Keanu didn't stop at just the special effects and costume teams. He also gave the entire stunt team on the ""Matrix"" sequels Harley Davidson motorcycles.",0

"An argument for and against potatoes:

Potatoes are a decent food source, even though they‚Äôre quite starchy and not the most nutritious. They can sustain like a whole-ass country for a while, unless they get blight and kill half of said country. Potatoes also make good compost with the major downside that they will sprout everywhere. And their baby potatoes are usually tiny but sometimes they taste good, so it‚Äôs a fair trade off. Overall, potatoes are good, but also will annoy the hell out of you if you are a gardener (or Irish)",0

"This will likely become one of the most important memories of her childhood, growing up years. 
My Daughter is 27 now, & my Husband is *THE BEST* 'girl-dad' on the planet. 
We had a waffle-maker when she was growing up, & I kept waffle-batter & this really delicious gourmet syrup in the fridge at all times. (Pro-tip: buy the really good, pricier stuff, in the glass bottle! It's SO worth it! Maple Grove Farms Organic Maple Syrup, available at Wal-Mart, is our favorite.)
Apparently quite often during her tween/teen years, if one of them heard the other downstairs in the kitchen during the middle of the night, the other would get up & they'd talk while they made & ate waffles together.
Even now, at 27, that is still one of her favorite memories of growing up with her Daddy, & I had no idea until she shared that memory & said that she wants to do the same thing with her (future, & hopefully soon) children one day.

It took me a minute but I was like ""....alright. Sure."" So I got out of bed and the two of us tip-toed down the hallway like a couple of goons to my brother's room. We flipped on the lights and I jumped on him and hit him in the face with a pillow, as is the Right of the Older Sibling. After my brother got over the indignity of utter defeat, we all sat on his bed and my dad read us The Night Before Christmas. Aside from it being 2am, it was as if we were little again.

One of the nicest Airbnb review I have ever seen,0
Awwwww!! That's so so sweet and kind. This lady is awesome.,0
"This is only wholesome if OP actually made it out, alive, from that air B&B. Based on that review, I think it‚Äôs fair to pose this question.",0
That‚Äôs more love from an air bnb host than I get from my actual mother.,0
Couple of months ago i rented an Airbnb for a month stay. Was planning to stay in that city for longer period (1 year). The owner didn‚Äôt let me leave. Cut down the price so I stay. Still Here Imao. I guess I‚Äôm paying for the cheapest place in entire country. Love my owner (an old french couple). It‚Äôs interesting how lucky I got.,0
"The one time I stayed at an airb&b was for my mom‚Äôs surgery for cancer. We stayed the first night, then I was supposed to be alone for the remaining 4-5 days while going back & forth to the hospital & getting moral supports from her friend & her friend‚Äôs daughter. The apartment was funky as heck and had a full drum set with an armory of other instruments. We jammed out the night before her surgery. Mom got wheeled back and the surgery that was supposed to last 4-5 hours only lasted 45 minutes because it became apparent it wasn‚Äôt going to be an option due to the surgeon finding another tumor. So, I had to tell my host that I‚Äôd have to leave early and the day kept being pushed back bcus my mom was still recovering in the hospital. Day of discharge, I‚Äôm standing out front of the apartment with one of the hosts and she told me she would comp my unused day as well as give me a free night whenever I choose to use it. I tried to say no, but I burst into tears and just sobbed. The kindness of a complete stranger is so foreign to me. Kindness hadn‚Äôt been in my life for years. We hugged and she let me cry on her shoulder. Needless to say Covid ruined my chance for staying this year for my bday if only because her and her husband took off to Florida to be closer to their son for a while. I touched base with her some months ago because she wanted an update and I honestly want this virus over with for many reasons but also so I can visit the purple house again.",0

chewy really be the best pet supply company. i have heard so many nice stories about them. too bad they dont ship to canada,0
"Honestly chewy.com is pretty great. I've only bought one thing from them for an emergency situation, but I realized that it wasn't necessary anymore so I cancelled it in a few hours. 

They had already started shipping though, so when I reached out to them about this, they said that since shipping has started they can't cancel the order but they'll give me a full refund and I can just donate the item when it gets to me. It was very generous of them to do that.",0

Humanity is alive in corporate America - that gives me hope. Thanks for sharing.",0
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.,0
"I fucking love Chewy so much, they have a message on their boxes requesting that pictures of pets sitting in the boxes be sent to their Instagram. One time they even sent us a free toy ball with our order. 

We always order our dog food from them and we'll keep doing it for the rest of our dogs lives. This is how corporations should be.",0

I'm sorry for your loss but it sounds like your pupper had a great life with a great owner!",0
"Chewy is the fucking best. They send personalized birthday cards, tell you to donate rather than send stuff back, they never ask dumb questions as to ‚Äúwhy you accidentally ordered the wrong food‚Äù, and their customer service is phenomenal. 

I am so sorry you lost your boy. Please know that his spirit is never gone if you continue to keep his name in conversation ‚ù§Ô∏è

They‚Äôre always really heavy & when we get a whole semi truck full of them, it‚Äôs like pulling teeth getting folks to load or unload them. Not anymore.

"Her main weapons are string based centered on immobilizing an opponent without harming them, and supporting/healing party members to ensure they're fine.

She's also the main interrogator, because her genuine concern for other's well-being and gentle demeanor naturally puts others off-guard, so she can get information rather easily. The downside is that she tends to ramble and so unless someone else is taking notes, the conversation will stray from cooking recipes, to the type of poison used in that pie he made, to her best in village pies, to what their home life was like and forget what info she was trying to get.",0

Some professors do give the extra half or 0.25 if they see that the student has good grades and he is serious but this one professor REFUUUSED.. because this will be unjust to us (the other students) so we all stormed his office asking him to give him the credit and he can take that 0.5 one from aaaall of us.. 
He still refused and there was other administrative things happening, but it was very emotional and interesting experience.. because we are all competitive and the 0.5 can deny you access to engineering schools(most of us go to uni for 2 years get good grades and then apply go to engineering schools) and masters, .. etc",0

"r/ThatHappened

err... how the uber driver still remember the face of their client after 8 month???,0
r/thathappened,0
this definitely isn't real.,0
Still finding logic in this.,0
Yeah definitely don‚Äôt try to return it when someone leaves something in your car,0
"Even if this was real which zero percent chance of that, how is it wholesome? He held onto that phone for 8 months instead of trying to return it or contact them, this person definitely had a new phone by that point as well",0
Uuuuhhhhh how is this wholesome?  This is creepy and gross.  He could have handed it in to lost and found.  He could have called her or put it in her mailbox.  Like.... what the fuck?,0
"I'll take ""things that never happened"" for $300, Alex",0
"He could have just messaged you to say he had it, or you could have messaged him. How would he remember you 8 months later?
This story is total BS",0
But how'd he call an Uber without a phone?,0
Uber has item return policy and not to mention Find My Phone unless it‚Äôs an android,0
"Y'all this is r/wholesome not  r/thewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth

Smh",0
"That‚Äôs fucking amazing. Good on him for doing that :)

One time my family member left their phone in an Uber and the Uber guy didn‚Äôt know. Tracking the phone from another device, the driver was heading away from my family member very quickly. But the driver was just going home for the night, and received the text from my family member that caused the driver to drive back and give the phone to my family member.",0
He got caught and had to give it back when the boss noticed a strange amount of phones went missing in his car,0
Honestly Id be pissed that he didnt try to give it back before...,0
"Feels somehow shady, don't know why",0
"1) If he knew you or had the ability to some how identify you, why didn't he contact you or hand it over to the police?  


2) Doesn't Uber have a rule on items left in the vehicle to be filed so customers can check a lost and found list??  


I get the wholesome intent behind this post, but this isn't all that wholesome when you really think about how there were several other better options.",0

"What helped me in my bipolar disorder was tracking my mood with daylio app over years to see my patterns.

Seeing my mood displayed in graphs over time allowed me to see it is very real and enabled me to not trust those thought in those depressed moments and have faith that things will get better because it allowed me to see the hypomania and good times too.

I knew things could be improved then and it didn't have to be depression forever.

I would advise anyone with mental health problems to track their mental health over time in an app to troubleshoot the problem and find out what works for you to reduce those depressions.

Really was helpful for me as it allowed me to view depression as a perception distortion. Seeing it in hard data just clicked for me.",0

I also tell her about her superpower which is kindness and how I love her empathic, gentle soul and how she is beautiful inside and out with an amazing strong body and mind. She knows when we are walking along holding hands when I give her hand a squeeze it means I‚Äôm saying I love you. 

This kid deeply knows she‚Äôs loved and my lap is always open for hugs and I‚Äôm always here just to be present with her. I am in no way perfect (and I am open about my flaws with her) but We are super close and every day I make sure she feels loved and will never feel like I did as a kid (or an adult for that matter too).

This is interesting. I usually sketch people on the train (NYC as well) and I always assumed that they would think I'm a creep rather than being happy about it. So I usually try to avoid them seeing me and never showed them what I do. Maybe I'll try this,0

"Here is my conspiracy theory, based on nothing but observation and some fell known facts. 

We domesticated wolves somewhere around 10,000 - 30,000 years ago. Go from a viscous carnivore to the hyper-social dogs over that time. Basically making their need for companionship more powerful than their predatory instincts over the centuries. Are we reaching the point, seeing possible evidence, where their need of companionship has caused them to benefit from ""nice and minorly altruistic"" behaviour becoming more prominent. Because people like dogs that are  friendly and nice. 

It's interesting to think about. Could we reach a point where dogs because extreme altruists? All supported by humanities love for cute, friendly, fluffy, dogs.",0

On the bright side, I lost 60 lbs while eating a massive amount of ice cream a day. Weaning was nightmarish- had to go on prolactin blockers. Wouldn't wish this condition on my worst enemy.",0

"I am a wedding officiant in Canada, and although I cannot speak to this couple‚Äôs situation, I have done this kind of a ceremony for a couple right before the bride passed away. 

For my couple, they were already life partners, best friends, and committed fully to each other. The wedding ceremony did not create anything new, but it was a reflection of the love and commitment that was already a reality for them. The last few days in the hospital were full of grief... but for a few hours they were able to embrace joy. They celebrated their love while still mourning the death they knew was coming. It gave their loved ones something to focus on and help with in the middle of a situation where they felt very powerless.

After the bride passed away, I stayed in touch with the groom, and their wedding ceremony remained a rare bright spot and an important moment for him. Instead of it being yet another thing that his love missed out on, it was a gift they could share.

My heart is with this groom and their community. I wish them peace as she journeys home.",0

Life has good and bad, yin and yang, a centuries old concept that some people can‚Äôt understand that you need the bad and the good. It psychological that the ups and the downs are what keeps and attracts us. I find it completely selfish that in this girls  possible final moments that some people could see this as not something to celebrate just because you expect to come here and see pictures of puppies or flowers or some shite. Like many have already said this is bittersweet and not everything is black and white. And in the end they both got what they wanted.. to an extent.",0

This post is beautiful, sad, inspiring, etc. But when I'm scrolling through my feed I'm generally not looking to be reminded of my friend who died of cancer at 25, or my Grandpa, or the fact that death is inevitable. I just want to see cute shit, y'all!",0

Though if I only had a few months to live or something I would 100% try to make the best of it and take all the money I have and like travel the world or try to find some comfort in death through studying religion to try to find out what I really believe in.

Man this really gets me thinking. Now that this is on my mind I really feel that everyone should look deeper into what they believe mainly religion because you never know how long you'll have left.

This holiday is about being thankful for the good parents and if you don't celebrate fathers or mothers day because of the BAD parents you've ruined the holiday and if you focus on the bad parents instead of the good your ruining the holiday, yes acknowledging the bad parents is ok but doing that on a holiday meant to celebrate the good ones is what I would argue is not right when the holiday is to celebrate the good parents and ignore the bad as they don't need a day if you ignore them or call a service to stop them your doing the right thing.

"My dad had no easy life. Grandma escaped with an American Soldier when he was three, Grandpa was a prisoner of war in Russia, later an Alcoholic (couldn't get over his Nazi past). 

My mom always tells me, my dad just started to be a child himself when I was born, and she suddenly had to care for two. He tried to do the right thing. Sold his small tax consultant office to a crook who never paid him, just to move to the town were my mom lived, although they actually already lived separate lives. (I am a little miscalculation by him.)  He missed his hometown, couldn't get along with the mentality. He got more and more of those fits of rage, screaming and throwing my toys at us (Never hurt my mom or me though). My mother got terribly sick when I was four because of all the fights and right before the operation, which no one knew if it could save her (she had an infected ovarian cyst, which pressed on her intestines, so she had to puke up everything she ate, almost died, because they didn't know what was wrong until they cut her open) so right before the operation I visited her, and as she saw me, she said to herself, that she has to throw this man out, if she survives.

Today I'm longing for the family memories that so many have, and my dad is like a distant uncle to me. He is a nice guy and I forgave him, although I still feel like I'm never gonna be whole again.

What I'm trying to say: try to forgive. It's better for you and some fathers just couldn't help themselves. Some of us grow up in fucked up circumstances, but we won't escape them with hate in our heart.",0

Though on the other hand maybe the consistent failure or lack of a father figure in his life is why Luke‚Äôs plea for help turns Vader against the emperor.

The guy hasn't been around, he's not a father type person, that is fine, I don't know what having a father would feel like, so I'm grand, I literally have neighbours I would miss more than him üòÇ",0
Don‚Äôt forget about deceased fathers...,0

Found this heart warming comment on a cute video of a mouse today!,0
Now you've got me looking at pictures of voles! They're really cute (;,0
To everyone saying it's a vole my bad I thought a vole was just a type of mouse (since in the video title it said it was a house. Also english isn't my native language,0
Says it's a vole right there in the comment,0
Cool profile pic!,0
Awwwwwwwwww :),0
Bro the comment legit said it‚Äôs a vole not a mouse wtf bro,0
"#God bless you,  Daniel",0
Wow what a cute mouse,0
I need a mouse now üò≠,0

"Mightve saved tiger, what a great person",0
Why is the heart upside down on the cat house?,0
"As cute as that is I hope tiger got taken to the vet and the care he needs.

Also that blink at the end is a sign of total love and trust that cat will die for you if it had too. 

Great work.",0
"I said it before and I‚Äôll say it again:

This cat in no way looks like a stray. It‚Äôs well groomed and chubby. It‚Äôs just a bit hostile, and she gained its trust. That‚Äôs normal. It‚Äôs probably fat because random people keep feeding it.

Ladies and gents, PLEASE stop feeding cats that turn up on your property. You may feed it food it can‚Äôt have, over feed it, or you may steal someone‚Äôs beloved pet.

The cat house is also insufficient because they need two entries/exits in case another cat ambushes them, and that blanket will absorb water and stay wet for far too long. Straw is far better for ‚Äústray‚Äù houses.",0

NBA player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is afraid of needles so while getting the COVID vaccine his teammate held his hand to comfort him.,0
You can tell they are really close because Shai is laughing behind that mask.,0
"As a banquet bartender, I‚Äôve met a ton of NBA players. 
It‚Äôs honestly SO refreshing to actually get to talk to them and realize that they‚Äôre regular dudes. 
I‚Äôm glad to see his teammate looking out for his family. üñ§üñ§üñ§",0
That‚Äôs so sweet,0
"Tip: Don't watch yourself getting jabbed. If you look away and keep talking you can distract yourself. If you watch, even if you have no fear of needles, your body tends to tense up, and tense muscles makes it hurt more. 

Your brain and central nervous system are wired to react to the sight of yourself being injured. It's an involuntary reflex related to our survival as a species.",0
Shy Shai,0
shai is also really good at what he does lol its crazy,0
My friends do this for me too-it helps a lot with a needle phobia!,0

On a different note, I've heard that watching the needle go in causes more anxiety and stress, increasing the pain you feel.",0
And they were teammates!,0
Probably doesn't help to watch tho lol,0
As someone who is terrified of needles... I totally get him.,0
Maybe he held his hand when he got his ears pierced too...because that shit really hurts :) wholesome either way though x,0

I have had Scotty since I was born. My husband has started tucking in him in when he makes the bed.,0

Also, we have Robbie, he is an orange deer.  Use to be my wifes.  Then daughter #1.  Then daughter #2.  And now it belongs to daughter #3.",0

I have a stuffed toy parrot. My husband had told me that I should get rid of Mr. Parrot or put him in a storage container somewhere.

My favorite uncle gave it to me when I was like 4 years old, I still remember that moment clearly. It‚Äôs the only thing I have left from my childhood that I still cherish and one of the few good memories I have. Mr. Parrot is currently sitting in my bedroom closet. Sometimes when I‚Äôm sad or depressed I hug my parrot... which never actually had a name I think.

I had let my kid hold it sometimes but he said it was creepy because it has white eyes and the black part of the eye is coming off so he says it looks creepy but my 5yo has a stuffed toy bear ‚ÄúBeary‚Äù thag he loves so much. I hope he keeps him for the rest of his life too.",0

She's currently learning how to draw in Togashi's style (Her husband) because of his really bad bouts of Lumbago and deteriorating health in the unfortunate scenario that he passes and she can complete it in his place. Crazy how two of the greatest Mangaka ended up dating and marrying.,0

"You deserve help if you need it, so don't be afraid to ask for it!",0
"I just listened to an episode of the grief cast featuring this artist, his name is Charlie Mackesy, I recommend.",0
"This hits home asking for help is like drinking a glass of bleach. I can be mangled on the ground from a car accident and then be like ""oh no im fine i dont want to be a bother""

Because when i asked for help from my dad help there was always a forceful reason to pay him back. He used to say if you want help you better pay me back thats how the world works no one helps for free

I also knew if I asked his help he would bring up so many things about me that he hated and then helped? 

It was like asking for help was a crime

So the people that are like this are either trying to hide from hatred and abuse or from being looked at as inadequate

It just felt soooo much easier to figure it out alone",0
"From Charlie Mackesy's book ""The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse"".",0

I saw this happening when I was in Japan and I was so impressed.

Now she's gonna be taking this man back to an apartment I helped pay for, pay for their dates with money from a Job I helped her get. Sleep with him on the bed I bought and watch TV with him on the TV I bought. I've been taken for a ride well and truly.

"I don't want to kill the mood, It was sweet to see him getting emotional and all, probabably for the thought and care people gave to him which is precious. 

But in all honesty, being a color blind and suddenly seing ""real"" colors in the world is like putting shades with filters that switch colors.
Our vision of colors is usually the same during our lifetime, so it's our reality that we are looking at, the glasses for color blinds are like new shades to see different colors.",0
True tears from color blindness over Jake Paul‚Äôs fake crying,0
!remindme 8 months,0
"I think the big highlight here is that he's never seen color, so he's adapted to a world without it, all along having been told that he doesn't know what he's missing, and then to suddenly feel the and see everything in the world for the first time in , I'm guessing at least 14 years? To recognize that all the beauty in the world was all around you and you're just now grasping at the reality of your world, to only now be acquainted with it all would be devastating at first.",0
Does anyone know how these glasses work? I'm really curious,0
"to be a bit technical, colorblind people can still see colors, they just aren‚Äôt as able to see either red, green, or blue as well. (source: genetics classes, colorblindness runs in my family and my brother and grandpa are red-green colorblind.)",0

Thank you very much for sharing this with us,0

"Yeah, lets celebrate the fact that a 13 year old needed to do this in order to pay for CLOTHES... capitalists will do anything but look at the root causes of these sorts of issues",0
"Litte sad little cool.

On one hand the fact that a 13 has to pay for his own school clothes is very sad and on the other he now has a permit to sell hot dogs... Thats something to put on a cv I guess... Yeah this is just sad",0
We have to stop considering the precarity of economy as something wholesome,0
"Positives of a state funded food cart

hes set up that if he wants to he can sell food as a job as an owner after high school

Decent personal income throughout school

Negatives

proof public school is worthless in the eyes of the state

why go to public school if most decent jobs want college just be your own boss 

Visible proof that the school system if failing


But serious now why is it whenever budget cuts roll around schools and infrastructure maintenance are the worst hit? growing up my town lost its archery team, track and field lost half it's equipment and by default was disqualified from participating in half the categories, band was saved by public donations, art class was almost axed if the teachers didn't pay for materials, history class still has text books from the early 90's, the library survives exclusively on donations from the towns public library, the school computers were all donated to the school and impossible to replace, funds for gym class equipment were diverted to football, 4th to 8th grade computer class was eliminated, wood shop was axed, and the most egregious was the town had one school nurse for 5 schools and the student councilors were underqualified to assist students with anything",0
Thats‚Äôs a $1000+ hotdog cart and a custom made apron.  Something seems fishy.,0

I Love this!!! So many people have negative prejudices about bats. It's so sad! When I show them how cute their little faces are, & explain that they look like little flying foxes, & tell them what caring mother's they are, & how they impact the ecosystem,  I've found that they can usually be educated to change their opinions. 

My two favorite quotes:

""In the end we will conserve only what we love; we will love only what we understand; and we will understand only what we are taught."" (Baba Dioum, 1968.)

""The ugliest thing I have ever seen is a human being without compassion."" (Unknown.)",0

How is feeding junk food to a baby wholesome?,0
"Yes, because showing your child that eating such large amounts of food is okay is so wholesome.",0
"Look, hamburgers aren't some kind of devil food, it's literally just meat and veggies and bread, but like, please don't give tiny children an entire burger. That portion is just... Way out there. Start em with half and check in, see if they're still hungry. It's good to teach your kids to be connected with their natural hunger cues. 

On a lighter note, that kid is suuuuuper cute",0
"It's wholesome until you realize that that's the flesh of an animal who lived a short life of pain, suffering and misery in a small cage. also this is unhealthy as fuck to give to a young ass kid.",0
"This is sad... I‚Äôm not vegan, just not one to feed my child junk food and pass it off as something wholesome.",0
She's so ugly like all babies,0
It should be illegal to feed children dead animals before they're even old enough to know that they're eating dead animals. There is nothing wholesome about this. This is just sad.,0

Back when I was testing for my green belt (this was almost 10 years ago), my instructors told me ""Scott, you're a very good martial artist. Don't punish yourself too harshly for not perfecting kata. Be patient with yourself and one day you'll become a great instructor"".

u/savevideobot,0
The little guy‚Äôs face at the end!!! I felt so bad!! üòÇ too cute!,0
It is wholesome. I like how they mostly kept it together knowing what was gonna happen.,0
"I can understand why people feel concerned about the guy yelling at the kid & the video cutting off there. 
For me, too, it hit almost too close to home (there was an incident when I was 4 where I thought a beloved relative was going to give me a hug after they allowed me to get out of the corner but they shoved me away & snapped at me... & honestly they probably didn‚Äôt ‚Äúshove‚Äù me away but that‚Äôs how I remember it happening‚Äî& no, this person was not a physically abusive or intentionally verbally abusive relative).
It‚Äôs true kids that young can be heavily influenced by events like this; that it *could* ‚Äúemotionally scar‚Äù the child and/or hurt the relationship they have with the adult (this could be said of any person of any age who feels spurned). It‚Äôs the reason this quote exists: ‚ÄúThe axe may forget, but the tree always remembers.‚Äù 
But as long as the parent/adult apologizes to the child or they laugh it off TOGETHER, it‚Äôs unlikely to leave any long-term damage.
That said, the fact that this child kissed the guy in the first place probably means they have a strong, loving relationship. I thought that was very cute!
But if they showed the ‚Äújust kidding!‚Äù part, it might detract from the ‚Äúfunniness‚Äù, which is what they were going for in this video.
I almost never give the benefit of the doubt, but with this video I will make an exception. The title, the mannerisms of the people in the video, and the fact that the kid assumed a kiss was the anticipated response all point to this being a very loving & happy family who joke around a lot.",0
This will get him far in life,0

Here's that NPC song again. üôÑ,0
I hate that they use this music in all these kinds of videos but I love the content,0

"That was also truly the least cringe woah I‚Äôve ever seen being done too, love this",0
these are the cool teachers. the ones who can start conversations with there students and can wow them like this,0
Singapore education go brrr,0
I also had a cool teacher like this. He was teaching us about reciprocals so he did a headstand (Mind he was in his lates 40s). Glad to say that was the best class I had this year.,0
That was pretty wholesome but can someone explain to me the physics and/or aerodynamic behind it,0
My physics teacher did this exact thing a couple of weeks ago,0
Finest mind of his generation,0
"He was my physics teacher, dude saved my phy grades from F9 to B3üòÇ though this dabbing vid came out a year or 2 later I'm really thankful to have been taught by him :"")",0
"Yeah fuck the a-math textbook, I hate it",0
Teacher is adorable in such a pure and wholesome way.,0
I love how everyone lost their minds when he dabbed... including me lol,0

That was legit the single smoothest dab I seen in my life.,0
YOOOO,0
didn't expect that dab coming lol,0
"Awesome teachers make a difference

Good teachers can change lives.,0
"Even tho he dabbed, I'll allow it.",0
"I ever had a teacher in his 50s climb onto the teacher's table, jump and land on the ground to prove something. He's a great teacher and we were all worried he would hurt himself, but he himself was so excited to do it. Still thankful for the time we shared in secondary school.",0
"Unfortunately for him, he was actually reprimanded for this in Singapore due to some stuck-up principal.",0
This is how teachers should be. Demonstrative and actually show the students practical or real-life implications of what they're ~~studying~~ grinding for.,0

May I please get the blank template version of this to share to my wife?,0
someone needs to show this to dr seuss,0
Can confirm. My parent's marriage is exactly like this and they're so sweet to each other after 30+ years that complete strangers could identify it from the way my brother and I spoke to each other as children.,0
"I'd happily take Laundry, Cooking and Handyman to have someone else spin cleaning.  Laundry is like half an hour once a week, cooking and fixing stuff is fun.  I just hate cleaning.",0

This made my week! meaning *I* am the superior sad pathetic loser!",0
"What a kind & considerate child.  It amazes me how some children are just wired this way (my baby brother is like that). I‚Äôve been conditioned to be considerate of others (thanks to my wonderful parents), but I was born a brat with a mean streak. I envy this little boy.",0

"This is a really sweet story too. The man is called Ken from Preston, UK and is a war veteran (WW2 - Navy) and was married to his wife Ada for 71 years before she passed away last August. Since then, Ken slept with a photograph of Ada every night. His carer, Kia, is 17 and likely earns a pittance and still took the time to have the cushion made for him. It's wonderful. You hear a lot of negative care home stories but the compassion she shows is heartwarming.",0

Romantic relationships aren‚Äôt the only or ultimate relationships,0
Ngl that's really cute and nice.,0
"This is true. I think it‚Äôs because finding someone you love is an amazing feeling. People who feel it want everyone to feel it. And you hope they get to someday. 

How do tell someone not to strive for the best feeling in the whole world? Loving someone and having them love you back. 

But this is true. Not everyone will find someone. Pressuring someone to find love will undoubtedly make them settle for an average relationship. 

What‚Äôs the right balance? I‚Äôm not sure. Love is amazing, but only when it‚Äôs done right.",0

"Imo this is the kind of thing that backfires. That‚Äôs just me though, aggression has never worked for me as a kid because due to traumatic events I was very sensitive. I‚Äôm one to internalize and relive rather than get visibly upset, then write down a vent and gather it into a letter I‚Äôd give to the one who upset me. If you internalize + relive as well it might work for you. Try it, see if it goes well :) if not, sorry for wasting your time. You probably need to express it verbally, and get feedback.

My Husband is much more sentimental, & although he isn't one to cry over nothing, it isn't uncommon for him to tear up when watching a movie or something. He cried at our wedding; when our Daughter was born; when he ""gave her away"" at her wedding; when I was sick & admitted to the critical care unit; when our pups have been put to sleep. He's one hell of a good man- I'm one very, *very* lucky lady. He's been a wonderful Husband & the best 'girl' Dad anyone could ever hope for.

"While I am happy for the woman, the fact that it has been recorded kind of screams ""Hey look at how much of a good person I am!""

And on top of that, the man was clearly prepared to tip her $50, why didn't he just do that without the theatrics?

Plus the music underscoring it makes the whole thing kind of cringey. Does the editor think that the audience needs a signal to tell them how to feel while watching this?

This whole video is so clearly to fuel the ego of the person doing the ""good deed"". If you require the world to know whenever you've done a good deed so they can see that you're a good person, you're probably not a good person.

"Not to take anything away from your beautiful dog, but it is rare for this type of electrical issue to cause a fire. All those elements you see, are rated for very high temperatures, for at least an hour. Now, if you have combustible elements near them, then this can definitely cause a fire. As an electric technician, I see this type of thing at least 10 times a month. That being said, it is amazing to me that your dog was able to make you aware this was happening.",0

"My family didn‚Äôt get fast food from the major brands when I was a child so I had to learn about each of them when I was older and buying meals while travelling as group. My first experience with subway was so stressful. I knew basically what I was supposed to do but I was seeing each of the options for the first time and expected to choose immediately. The person making my sandwich seemed angry when I asked questions so I just skipped most parts and had a really bland sandwich. The second time I went, I was with a friend and we weren‚Äôt in a rush so we stood back for a while and she talked me through it all so I had all of my choices planned before I started my order. I still prefer to pack a sandwich from home but I am have great respect for people who don‚Äôt assume something is easy just because they‚Äôve been doing it for as long as they can remember.",0

"When I was 14 I went to lunch with my grandmother. She saw a friend from church and pulled out her purse and started showing pictures of her grandkids, including me. That moment was a wave of ""wow, she really does love me"". I cut out the pictures of all of my grandparents from their church directories (they were like a published book back in the 90s) and put them in my wallet so I could show everyone pictures of my grandparents, just like my grandma did with me and my siblings and cousins.

Grandparents can be a precious gift. Mine have been gone for years now, but they will never be forgotten. I still have pictures of them all in my house. I only hope that if I become a grandpa I can show as much love and kindness as they did for me. 

Hang in there OP. Remember her fondly and often.",0

Aww she looks like she was just the biggest sweetheart of a nana. She probably told the best stories.,0
That's a great photo!  Sorry for your loss.  There is a gift in loss...it's that you learn what really matters in life.  That all the little things that stress you out don't really mean that much in the end.  It's spending time with people that matter most.  Perspective is very different when you realize how quickly life can be lost.  Make the most of it and make your nana proud.,0

"Dear Nat,

This weekend. I'm studying for a uni exam at the moment. It's going to be tricky but I like the subject so I'm enjoying the process anyway. I'm also checking the news occasionally hoping for the sake of America that Trump doesn't get another term - I didn't think I'd ever follow American politics this closely.

Lately I've been listening to Jonah Yano. I dont know how to describe his style of music but it's those beats that make you want to lay on your bed and remember better times. I haven't heard of twice but I'll give them a listen :) 

I hope you ace that book report, what book are you writing about? 

American or British Office? 

Have a great weekend mate,

Steph",0
"Thank you mate, never thought a random stranger would make my day!",0
"Hi Nat! 

This week was a rough one, but I got through it. I hope yours was smooth sailing from start to finish.

Tomorrow is N7 Day at my house! It‚Äôs an unofficial holiday for the video game Mass Effect. Since it‚Äôs one of my husband‚Äôs favorite games, I try to do something special for him each year. 
We love The Office! Which season are you on? Do you have a favorite character? 

I have a bad habit of sticking to the same artists and not branching out. Recently I‚Äôve been listening to a lot of Red Hot Chili Peppers. I didn‚Äôt get into them until a year or two ago, so they‚Äôre still sort of new for me. Do you have a favorite artist or musical genre? 

Thanks for taking the time to write. You‚Äôre thoughtful! I hope you have a great weekend. Good luck on that book report! 

Best,
Dawn",0
Thanks Nat I needed that,0
"Thanks! I'm not feeling lonely, but your kind words made my day happier.

I have to leave my house in the beginning of next year. I would live in my car if I didn‚Äôt have an 17 month old son. You know what.. it‚Äôs hard to be excited about anything right now. Be kind to the older people in your lives. We‚Äôre going through a lot right now and our main concern is how we‚Äôre going to take care of you guys and keep you safe, so take it easy on us, and don‚Äôt give us such a hard time about not being able to keep our cool right now.",0
